RTS-Serialisation
=================

This repository contains Haskell code to demonstrate a serialisation API
provided by the Parallel Haskell runtime system for Eden 
(see http://github.com/jberthold/ghc).

Most files in the repository are here for testing purposes, the actual
library code is GHC/Packing.hs and Control.Monad.Checkpoint.hs.

This is experimental code, comments and contributions are most welcome.
